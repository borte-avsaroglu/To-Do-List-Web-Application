At first, I designed my project as a draft on the program, I poured my thoughts there, and then I wrote my code.
For you to see, there are my designs related to the page in the Design file.

The design and CSS in my project is entirely my own. Besides, I used Google fonts, Font Awesome and Bootstrap 4 libraries.
